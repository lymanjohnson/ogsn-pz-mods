Sugarskull's Craftable Dairy Foods Mod
=============================================================================================

This mod is a designed to work on the beta branch (IWBUMS), currently Version 41.

This Project Zomboid mod allows player to craft milk, yogurt, cheese, and butter.

The recipes for yogurt, cheese, and butter must be learned from a new Good Cooking Magazine,
which can be found in magazine shelves, mailboxes, book stores, etc.

Strainer, powdered milk, and yogurt culture can be found in kitchens, groceries, convenience
stores, retaurants, etc. Spawns for jars and jar lids have also been increased.

Cheese Preparation and Yogurt Preparation must be cooked before you can turn into usable
cheese and yogurt.

Base game recipes have been updated to accept crafted milk and yogurt. Crafted cheese and
butter are the same as base game items so will work the same.
