description=[h1]They're not my kids but they have nowhere else to go[/h1]
description=My [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2056238799]lockpicking mod[/url] was forked from an older version by modder MeTaLAnGeR, that is no longer being maintained.
description=That version included changes from several much older mods that were unrelated to the locksmithing mechanics, so I removed them from my version.

description=One of those, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1939995891]Craftable Dairy Products and is now being maintained here[/url]

description=The rest of them will live here until someone else decides to give them a better home. They include:
description=[list]
description=[*]Forageables and Trapping - Originally [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1096904850]Wilhelm's Wilderness Improvements[/url]
description=[*]Jarring Meats - Originally [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1537876121]Bottling of Meat[/url]
description=[*]Super Garlic - Originally part of Forageables and Trapping but it rather overpowered so I felt compelled to split it into its own submod.
description=[*]Two Additional Traits - Archer and Forager
description=[/list]
description=Please be aware that I am not terribly fond of any of these and don't use them in my own games. I will fix bugs and keep them compatible with IWBUMS, but I am not planning to improve or expand on them.
