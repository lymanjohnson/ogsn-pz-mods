description=[h1]Features[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*]Split stir fry and roasted vegetables into bowls, like you can with other recipes, instead of having to keep them in the pan forever
description=[*]Use wine and whiskey in appropriate recipes
description=[*]Fixes pasta/rice bug. Pasta and rice dishes now eventually spoil, just like any other dish. This does NOT include dry uncooked rice and pasta, which are still shelf stable.
description=[*]Use foraged herbs as spices and ingredients in recipes
description=[*]Add milk, nuts, fruits, etc. to oatmeal
description=[*]Beans are a happy food and can be used in many recipes
description=[*]Make teas with foraged herbs. These teas amplify their medicinal effects slightly.
description=[*]Craft tea blends. There are two blends, each with three ingredients. The blended tea combines the effects of its components, and boosts their effects slightly more.
description=[*]Full compatibility and synergy with the mods "All American Apocalypse" and "Craftable Dairy Foods".
description=[*]Optional: Makes it so that foraged herbs eventually rot

description=[h1]Planned Features[/h1]
description=[list]
description=[*]Create shelf-stable versions of foraged herbs by drying them. This makes them lose a small bit of happiness and potency.
