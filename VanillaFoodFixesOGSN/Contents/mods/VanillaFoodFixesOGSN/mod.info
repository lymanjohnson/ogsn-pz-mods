id=VanillaFoodFixesOGSN
description=This mod includes many common sense fixes to vanilla foods.
description=
description=Stir fries and roast vegetables can now be transferred into bowls, rather than needing to be kept in the pan forever.
description=Beans are now a happy food and can be used in many recipes.
description=Pasta and rice dishes now eventually spoil, just like any other dish. This does NOT include dry rice and pasta, those are still shelf stable.
description=Oatmeal can now be spruced up with milk, honey, fruits, and nuts.
description=You can now use wine and whiskey as ingredients in some cooking recipes.
description=Herbs can be used as spices or ingredients in recipes, as well as used to brew herbal teas that are slightly more potent than their components.
description=Herbs eventually go bad. If you don't like this change, there is an optional submodule right below this one that will make them last forever.
description=
description=Fully compatible and synergistic with the mods "All American Apocalypse" and "Craftable Dairy Foods" and the food changes from "FMJ Lockpicking".
